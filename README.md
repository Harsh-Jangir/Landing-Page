#  Landing Page (HTML & CSS)

A simple and clean landing page built using only HTML and CSS. This project was made to practice layout design, and basic styling without using any frameworks or JavaScript.

##  About

This landing page includes a header, hero section, feature highlights, and a footer â€” all styled from scratch with CSS. The goal was to focus purely on structure and design using clean and semantic HTML.

##  What I Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)  
- Google Fonts  
- Font Awesome (for icons)
